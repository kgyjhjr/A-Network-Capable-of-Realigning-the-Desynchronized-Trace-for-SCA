# A-Network-Capable-of-Realigning-the-Desynchronized-Trace-for-SCA
This repository contains examples for reproducing the results presented in "A-Network-Capable-of-Realigning-the-Desynchronized-Trace-for-SCA: Multi-Channel Transmission CNN Based on Wavelet Scatter Transform".
We have provided the full source code and pre-trained models here, just run "train model.py" under each dataset.
If you want to attack the desynchroized dataset set with a larger delay interval, manually modify the files "ReadASCADf_long.py" and "ReadASCADr_long.py" in the "Dataset\Desyn\" directory.The delay interval can be adjusted manually.
